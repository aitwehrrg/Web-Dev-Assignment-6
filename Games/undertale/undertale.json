  "description": "Undertale is a unique RPG where you don't have to kill anyone. In this game, you play as a child who has fallen into the Underground, a secluded region beneath the surface of the Earth, populated by monsters. The player interacts with various monsters, navigating through bullet hell-style combat, and chooses whether to befriend or fight them. The game is known for its innovative gameplay mechanics, memorable characters, and multiple endings based on player choices.",
